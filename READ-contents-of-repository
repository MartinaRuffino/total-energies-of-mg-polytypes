This repository contains input files used for the calculation of total energies to be employed in the calculation of
stacking fault energies via the use of Ising-like models and supercells.
Two total energy methods were used: the generalised pseudopotential theory (GPT) and density functional theory (DFT) 
in the LMTO implementation.
Input files for each total enery calculation method are organised by polytype (2H, 4H, etc.), used for Ising-like models.
Supercell input files are found in the "supercell-2h" subdirectories for each total energy calculation method.
