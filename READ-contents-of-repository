This repository contains input files used for the calculation of total energies to be employed in the calculation of
stacking fault energies via the use of Ising-like models and supercells.
Two total energy methods were used: the generalised pseudopotential theory (GPT) and density functional theory (DFT) 
in the LMTO implementation.
The binary code for the GPT as well as pair potentials can be found in paper-data/gpt/gpt-binary .
The binary codes for LMTO-DFT can be found in paper-data/dft/lmto-code.
Input files for each total enery calculation method are organised by polytype (2H, 4H, etc.), used for Ising-like models.
Supercell input files are found in the "supercell-2h" subdirectories for each total energy calculation method.
