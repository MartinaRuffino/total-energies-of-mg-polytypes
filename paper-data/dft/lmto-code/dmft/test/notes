Files needed to run

sig.inp
ctrl.lsco
basp.lsco
indmfl.lsco
sigm.lsco

run lmfdmft

CTQMC requires:
delta.inp.lsco -> Delta.inp
eimp1.lsco -> Eimp.inp
PARAMS
Trans.dat

The contents of Eimp.inp eventually make its way into the CTQMC file PARAMS, which contains something like
Ed  [-84.185170505, -83.709996585, -84.737178325, -85.187325195, -84.185170505, -83.709996585, -84.737178325, -85.187325195]
Ed is Eimp - constant double counting.

Note also PARAMS contains a line like:
mu  84.185170505  	  # QMC chemical potential
The parameter is just the first element in Ed*(-1) --- it is not the chemical potential

These files are used by a script (written by Paolo, Lorenzo) which calls atom_d.py, and which creates actqmc.cix.

It has information about impurity level.  Also reads


Q1.  Duplication of delta.inp.lsco, Delta.inp   and eimp1.lsco, Eimp.inp
     Can lmfdmft just write delta.lsco and eimp.lsco?  Let the scripts do the translating

Q2.  sig.inp.  Lines appear in comment at header.  
     Can we just write a file dmftsig.ext?  Let the scripts do the translating.

Q3.  Can ncorrch be defined as the highest channel for a DMFT block?
     Or should it be (2*l+1)*nsp?

Q4.  compressproj has both orbmax and ndsig.  Are they distinct?

What are the proper definitions of these variables?

!r  ndsigi   Number of correlated orbitals in correlated block, including spin
             Was called ncorrch
!r  qsplit   Defines the basis used according to file legend qsplit in dmft
!r  wndim    Size of sigind matrix for each cix block
!r  csize    Number of independent components of sigind matrix for each cix block

Q5.  What is  strans:  in compressproj?
