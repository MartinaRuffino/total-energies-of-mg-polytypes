2015-05-19  Log of Lorenzo Sponza's modification of the code

24/4
 New branch sponza opened and ready to modify sudmft to include update of chem.pot.

29/4
 Added the calculation of the electronic density N and its derivatives
 (analytical and taking imaginary part of Green's function).
 It does not reproduce the reference number N=53.
 DO TESTS AND GET 53!!!

01/5
 Can't get 53 electrons.
 tryied with sum over all bands and sum over occupied bands only. 
 Doesn't get more than 18


 07/5
 The calculation of the electron number has been implemented and tested.
 The subroutine has 4 modes:
 mode 0 is the best one, with cured singularity and fermi function.
        however, it works pretty well only if kT is 
	set by hand equal to BZ_W.
 modes 1,2,3 are testing modes without the io=0.0 singularity cured.
        They do not work horribly for deep valence, but as long as the 
	singularity gets sharper, they don't work anymore.
	A different way to cure the singularity may be used,
	 under the assumption that Im[eik(0.0)]=0.0 which is true if
	 the imaginary part is an unpair function.

 08/5
 The minimization of Nref-N made by rfarsi seems to work fine,
  but it can't find a solution because the density has a discontinuity,
  so the algorithm is stuck and oscillates between different values.
  MOST LIKELY the source of the error is the fact that in computing the
  density I'm summing over occupied bands, not all bands.
  This introduces a discontiuity. The sum over bands has to be done over all
  bands.
