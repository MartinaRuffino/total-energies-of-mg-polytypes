      subroutine prjrsp(nsp,nspc,icplx,nRLc,nkp,P0)
C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ci Inputs
Ci   nsp   :2 for spin-polarized case, otherwise 1
Ci   nspc  :2 if spin-up and spin-down channels are coupled; else 1.
Ci   icplx :1 if P0 is real, 2 if P0 is complex
Ci   nRLc  :dimensions P0
Ci   nkp   :number of k-points which there is a P0
Cio Inputs/Outputs
Ci   P0     :some rows and columns of P0 are projected out to conserve
Ci          charge neutrality; see Remarks
Cl Local variables
Cl   nspx   :number of separate spin channels
Cl           =1 except in collinear spin-polarized case
Cl   nRLx   :nRLc * nspc
Cr Remarks
Cr  Renormalization:  the response function P0 as calculated from Dyson's
Cr  equation does not preserve charge neutrality.  Thus for the last
Cr  energy point (last=.true.), gfp0ft projects out a portion of the
Cr  response function P0, so that any single potential shift preserves
Cr  charge neutrality, and a uniform potential shift conserves charge in
Cr  each of n channels.  Let T be the following projector matrix
Cr
Cr                (1 1 ... 1)
Cr      T =  n^-1 (1 1 ... 1)   with n = number of rows in T
Cr                (...      )
Cr                (1 1 ... 1)
Cr
Cr  All eigenvalues of T are zero except except one whose eigenvalue is
Cr  1, and whose eigenvector is z=(1,1,...,1)/sqrt(n).  Thus,
Cr  1-T = z+ eps z   operating on a matrix P0 subtracts out the
Cr  projection of P0 onto this eigenvector.  The dual projection
Cr      P0' = (1-T) P0 (1-T)
Cr  projects out the sum of charges for a potential shift in any channel
Cr  and also the induced charge in any channel arising from a uniform
Cr  shift in all channels.  It is readily seen that
Cr      (P0' - P0)_ij = 1/n sum_k (-P0_kj - P0_ik + 1/n sum_l P0_lk)
Cr  The response function P0_ij, defined as dq_i = sum_j P0_ij dV_j
Cr  is merely the imaginary part of P0_ij.
