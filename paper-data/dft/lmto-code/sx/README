--- Screened exchange package (v6.11) ---

This is the screened-exchange (SX) code adapted from Holger Rucker.
It is still under development.

The call entry is asasx, which executes the following flow :

      1.   Make the unscreened static response function P0 (asxp0).
           This is an asa-version: which means in this context,
           (a) "bare" potential V0 is just Madelung matrix + local terms
           (b) local term is a single number for each l.

      2.   Make the nonlocal, static screened W from P0 and V0 (wstat)

      3.   Subtract of the "local part" to W, done in one of two ways.
           (v1)  the local part of P0 is calculated, and W[ploc] taken
           for the static part
           (v2)  W(q->0) estimated assuming W(q) prop q**2.

      4.   Make Sigma(W) - Sigma(Wloc).  This is a perturbation correction

      5.   (Optional) inverse Bloch transform Sigma.

      6.   For each qp, add delta Sigma to potential, recalculate evals
           and evecs.

           Repeat steps 4,5,6 for niter times.

--- Test cases and illustrations ---
sx/test/test.sx checks out that the sx package is working properly,
                At present, there is only one case.
