--- ASA layer Green's function package (v6.11) ---

This package implements the ASA local spin-density approximation using
Green's functions in a special layer geometry.  It adds a program
`lmpg' to the ASA suite, which plays approximately the same role as
the LMTO-ASA band program `lm' or the crystal Green's function program
`lmgf'.

--- Installation ---
To install, invoke `configure' with --enable-gf

--- Documentation ---
See file doc/pgf.txt for documentation.

--- Test cases ---

Shell script pgf/test/test.pgf checks out that the program is working
properly, and it also is convenient to illustrate some of the features
in lmpg.
