The development and expansion of Questaal Suite has been led by Mark van Schilfgaarde since its inception. During his time with Ole Anderson’s group at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Institute (1987-1988), Mark implemented Ole’s new tight-binding formulation of the LMTO-ASA method. This code served as the foundation for the well known Stuttgart LMTO-ASA package, and for many descendants of it, including an ASA-GW code by Aryasetiawan, the original formulation of LDA+U, an early formulation of noncollinear magnetism and of linear response for spin waves, and a the first implementation of exact exchange.

There have been many contributors; a partial list is provided below.
