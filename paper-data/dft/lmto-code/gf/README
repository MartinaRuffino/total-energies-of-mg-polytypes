--- ASA Green's function package (v6.11) ---

This package implements the ASA local spin-density approximation using
Green's functions.  It adds a program `lmgf' to the ASA suite, which
plays approximately the same role as the LMTO-ASA band program `lm'.

--- Installation ---
To install, invoke `configure' with --enable-gf

--- Documentation ---
See file doc/gf.html for documentation.

--- Test cases and examples ---

Shell script gf/test/testgf checks out various branches of lmgf; it
also is convenient to illustrate some of the features in lmgf.  You
can run this script for one of the following cases:

  gf/test/test.gf co    (hcp Co)
  gf/test/test.gf fccfe (fcc fe, noncollinear case)
  gf/test/test.gf mnpt  (MnPt3)
  gf/test/test.gf mnn   (MnN in the ZB structure)
  gf/test/test.gf nife  (INVAR alloy FeNi--- this takes a long time to run!)

You can invoke all tests with
  gf/test/test.gf --all
