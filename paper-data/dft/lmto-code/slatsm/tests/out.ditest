1Test of I(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   2000 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 I(X,ALPHA) was larger   807 times,
                agreed   489 times, and
           was smaller   704 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of     0.1959E-14 =    2 ** -48.86
    occurred for X = 0.158844E+01 and NU = 0.129939E+00

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 See documentation for DIBESL for details

 DIBESL will be called with the argument-0.100000E+01 and nb+alpha 0.550000E+01
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and DIBESL returned the value 0.000000E+00  ok = F

 Tests near the largest argument for scaled functions

 DIBESL will be called with the argument 0.125000E+04 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and DIBESL returned the value 0.112838E-01  ok = T

 DIBESL will be called with the argument 0.100012E+05 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and DIBESL returned the value 0.000000E+00  ok = F

 Tests near the largest argument for unscaled functions

 DIBESL will be called with the argument 0.354500E+03 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and DIBESL returned the value 0.192086+153  ok = T

 DIBESL will be called with the argument 0.709087E+03 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and DIBESL returned the value 0.000000E+00  ok = F

 This concludes the tests.
