1Test of Y(X,ALPHA) vs Multiplication Theorem


   1989 Random arguments were tested from the interval ( 0.00, 2.00)


 Y(X,ALPHA) was larger   883 times,
                agreed   329 times, and
           was smaller   777 times.


 NOTE: first  11 arguments in test interval skipped
       because multiplication theorem did not converge


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of     0.2429E-14 =    2 ** -48.55
    occurred for X = 0.175088E+01 and NU = 0.447526E+00

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 Tests near the largest acceptable argument for DYBESL

 DYBESL will be called with the arguments 0.335544E+08 0.500000E+00
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and DYBESL returned U(1) =  0.296749E-04

 DYBESL will be called with the arguments 0.536871E+09 0.500000E+00
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and DYBESL returned U(1) =  0.000000E+00

 This concludes the tests.
