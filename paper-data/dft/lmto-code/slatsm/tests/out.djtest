                agreed   511 times, and
           was smaller   726 times.


 There are  53 base   2 significant digits in a floating-point number


 The maximum relative error of     0.1469E-14 =    2 ** -49.27
    occurred for X = 0.180541E+01 and NU = 0.429941E-02

1Check of Error Returns


 The following summarizes calls with indicated parameters

 NCALC different from MB indicates some form of error

 See documentation for DJBESL for details

       ARG            ALPHA      MB      B(1)      NCALC


  0.1000000E+01  0.1500000E+01    5  0.0000000E+00   -1


  0.0000000E+00  0.1000000E+01    2  0.0000000E+00   -1


 -0.1000000E+01  0.5000000E+00    5  0.0000000E+00   -1


 Tests near the largest acceptable argument for DJBESL

 DJBESL will be called with the argument 0.999878E+04 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 NCALC returned the value    2
 and DJBESL returned U(1) =  0.630030E-02  ok = T

 DJBESL will be called with the argument 0.100012E+05 and nb+alpha 0.250000E+01
 This should trigger an error message.
 NCALC returned the value   -1
 and DJBESL returned U(1) =  0.000000E+00  ok = F

 This concludes the tests.
