2003-09-23  Tony Paxton

	* Partial core occupation

	* Bug fixes in core-level spectroscopy

2002-07-22  Mark van Schilfgaarde  <markv@waldo.eas.asu.edu>

	* Added code for self-consistent GW.

	* small bug fix in gvlist renders GW and FP results slightly
	  different

2002-06-40  Sergey Faleev

	* Changed sugw for self-consistent GW.

2002-06-18  mark van schilfgaarde  <markv@waldo.ran.sandia.gov>

	  for energy integration.

2002-04-17  mark van schilfgaarde  <markv@waldo.ran.sandia.gov>

	* Local orbitals added to GW driver; GW code redesigned
	  for local orbitals.

2002-03-07  mark van schilfgaarde  <markv@waldo.ran.sandia.gov>

	* First cut at including local orbitals to gw driver.

	* Changed sugw from Takao's original convention for GcutH in making
	  matrix elements between IPW's (GcutH = gcutb*1.5d0) to using
	  lmf gmax : GcutH = gmax.

2001-06-01  mark van schilfgaarde  <markv@waldo.ran.sandia.gov>
