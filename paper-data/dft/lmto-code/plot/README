This package includes a general-purpose plotting program with functionality
roughly similar to gnuplot, and programs 'plbnds' and 'pldos' designed
to read energy bands and density-of-states written by the Questaal package
to create postscript figures.

------------------- Installation using configure ----------------

To install with configure you must have first installed the slatsm library, which is a
library of generic math functions, and whose tar file is SLATSM.vsn-no.tar.gz
Installation of that package creates an archive 'slatsm.a'

With luck, this package will install automatically, using 'configure'
If you have trouble, look at the README in the slatsm library for
guidance on how to make corrections specific to your platform

Standard way to install:

1.  Assign environment variable LIBSLA path of slatsm.a, e.g.
    LIBSLA = /usr/people/markv/slatsm/slatsm.a

2.  Invoke 'configure'

3.  Invoke 'make -f Makefile progs'

Now programs 'fplot', 'pldos' and 'plbnds' should be created.  To check them
one-by-one (and also see examples of how the programs work) invoke scripts

4.  examples/test.fplot
    examples/test.pldos
    examples/test.plbnds

Alternatively, you can invoke

4.  make -f Makefile check

which just runs the three shell scripts in 'quiet' mode --- useful
for quickly checking correct functioning of programs.

Finally, you can install these programs into a bindir (defaults to ../bin)
with

5.  make -f Makefile install
