<H1><B><FONT size="+1">Syntax of integer lists</FONT></B></H1>

Integer lists are used in a wide variety of contexts, e.g. as part of the preprocessor &nbsp;<FONT size="+1"><tt>% repeat</tt></FONT>&nbsp; directive.

<BR>

The syntax is a sequence of strings separated by commas:

<pre>
       <i>strn1</i>,<i>strn2</i>,...
</pre>

Each of the &nbsp <FONT size="+1"><tt><i>strn1</i>, <i>strn2</i>, ... </tt></FONT> &nbsp; assumes one of the following three forms:

<pre>
   (a)   a single integer or algebraic expression

   (b)   two integer expressions separated by a colon, viz
            low:high
         It gets expanded into:
            low, low+1, low+2, ... high

   (c)   Three integer expressions separated by colons, viz 
            low:high:step
         It gets expanded into:
            low, low+step, low+2*step, ... high
</pre>

  Examples:
<pre>
    `5+1'       becomes a single number, 6.
    `5+1:8+2'   becomes a sequence of numbers, 6 7 8 9 10
    `5+1:8+2:2' becomes a sequence of numbers, 6 8 10.
    `1:4,7:11'  becomes the sequence 1 2 3 4  7 8 9 10 11.

</pre>
