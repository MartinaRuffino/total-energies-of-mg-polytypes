--- Noncollinear package (v6.11) ---

This package extends the ASA local spin-density approximation to the
noncollinear case, in the rigid spin approximation.  Also the forces
on the magnetic spin orientations is computed, and programs lm and
lmgf can use these forces to relax spin orientations to their ground
state.

--- Installation ---
Invoke `configure' with --enable-nc; see README.

--- Documentation ---
See file doc/nc.txt for documentation.

--- Test cases and examples ---

nc/test/test.nc checks out that the noncollinear package is working
                properly, and also illustrates some of the features.

nc/test/test.so checks the spin-orbit coupling branch.

You can invoke all tests in both packages with
  nc/test/test.nc --all
