--- Optics package (v6.11) ---

This package enables the computation of the q->0 dielectric response
function epsilon(omega) within the ASA.  It was adapted from a program
written by S. Rashkeev, who in turn adapted it from several other
authors.  Rashkeev also wrote a nonlinear optics code, but it is
not implemented here.

--- Installation ---
To install, add switch --enable-optics at configure time.

--- Documentation ---
See file doc/optics.doc for documentation.

--- Test cases and examples ---
optics/test/test.optics checks out that the package is working
                        properly.  At present there is only one 
                        test case (gan)
